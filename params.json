  "body": "# Introduction to the BLINKER pipeline\r\nBLINKER and associated tools are an automated pipeline for detecting eye blinks in EEG and calculating\r\nvarious properties of these blinks. BLINKER takes as input an arbitrary number of signals, which can\r\ninclude ordinary EEG channels, EOG channels and independent components (IC), determines which signals\r\nhave acceptable blinks and determining the optimal signal for determining blinks. \r\nBLINKER also has facilities for merging blinks calculating from different \r\nsource signals and for plotting individual blinks to facilitate manual evaluation and synchronization\r\nof EEG with video and eye tracking. BLINKER is designed to be run in a completely automated way. \r\nThe major sections of this document are:\r\n* Introduction (requirements, citing, installation)\r\n* Algorithm (steps, meaning of parameters for each step)\r\n* Running as an EEGLAB plug-in\r\n* Running as a script\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nThe BLINKER pipeline relies on the MATLAB Signal Processing toolbox, the MATLAB Statistics toolbox and EEGLAB, a freely-available MATLAB toolbox for processing EEG. EEGLAB is available from  [http://scn.ucsd.edu/eeglab](http://scn.ucsd.edu/eeglab). Various high-level BLINKER wrapper functions assume that the EEG data is provided as an EEGLAB EEG structure and that channel locations are provided in the EEG.chanlocs structure. However, low-level processing functions work directly\r\non signals.\r\n\r\n### Citing the BLINKER\r\nBLINKER is freely available under the GNU General Public License. \r\nPlease cite the following publication if using:  \r\n> Kleifges K, Bigdely-Shamlo N, Kerick S, and Robbins KA  \r\n> BLINKER: Large-scale automated analysis of ocular indices extracted from EEG  \r\n>  \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThe BLINKER pipeline can be run in two ways --- as a standalone toolbox or as an EEGLAB plugin. To run in standalone mode, simply download the BLINKER code, found in the EEG-Blinks github repository and\r\nrun the script runBlinkerPipeline after editing the locations of your input files.\r\n\r\n# BLINKER as an EEGLAB plugin\r\nYou can install BLINKER as an EEGLAB plugin by unzipping the BlinkerVxx directory into the plugins directory of your EEGLAB installation. \r\n\r\n## Running the BLINKER pipeline from EEGLAB\r\nLoad an EEG dataset to be processed using the Load dataset submenu under the File menu of EEGLAB.  \r\nThe BLINKER pipeline \r\ncan be found under the EEGLAB Tools submenu:  \r\n![BLINKER from EEGLAB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VisLab/EEG-Clean-Tools/gh-pages/images/PrepFromEEGLAB.png)  ",
