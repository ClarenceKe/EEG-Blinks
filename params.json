  "body": "# Introduction to the BLINKER pipeline\r\nBLINKER and associated tools are an automated pipeline for detecting BLINKS in EEG and calculating\r\nvarious properties of these blinks. pipeline is a standardized early-stage EEG processing pipeline that focuses on the identification of bad channels and the calculation of a robust average reference. PREP also has an extensive reporting facility. It is designed to be run in a completely automated way. The major sections of this document are:\r\n* Introduction (requirements, citing, installation)\r\n* Algorithm (steps, meaning of parameters for each step)\r\n* Running as an EEGLAB plug-in\r\n* Running as a script\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nThe BLINKER pipeline relies on the MATLAB Signal Processing toolbox and EEGLAB, a freely-available MATLAB toolbox for processing EEG. EEGLAB is available from  [http://scn.ucsd.edu/eeglab](http://scn.ucsd.edu/eeglab). BLINKER assumes that the EEG data is provided as an EEGLAB EEG structure and that channel locations are provided in the EEG.chanlocs structure.\r\n\r\n### Citing the BLINKER\r\nBLINKER is freely available under the GNU General Public License. \r\nPlease cite the following publication if using:  \r\n> Kleifges K, Bigdely-Shamlo N, Kerick S, and Robbins KA  \r\n> BLINKER: Large-scale automated analysis of ocular indices extracted from EEG  \r\n>  \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThe BLINKER pipeline can be run in two ways --- as a standalone toolbox or as an EEGLAB plugin. To run in standalone mode, simply download the BLINKER code, found in the EEG-Blinks github repository and\r\nrun the script runBlinkerPipeline after editing the locations of your input files.\r\n\r\n# BLINKER as an EEGLAB plugin\r\nYou can install BLINKER as an EEGLAB plugin by unzipping the BlinkerVxx directory into the plugins directory of your EEGLAB installation. \r\n\r\n## Running the BLINKER pipeline from EEGLAB\r\nLoad an EEG dataset to be processed using the Load dataset submenu under the File menu of EEGLAB.  \r\nThe BLINKER pipeline \r\ncan be found under the EEGLAB Tools submenu:  \r\n![BLINKER from EEGLAB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VisLab/EEG-Clean-Tools/gh-pages/images/PrepFromEEGLAB.png)  ",
